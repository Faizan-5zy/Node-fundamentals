**Interview questions related to the provided Node.js script could cover various aspects, including command-line arguments, file system operations, and error handling. Here are some potential questions:**

1. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - How are command-line arguments accessed in a Node.js script?
   - Explain the purpose of `process.argv` in this script.
   - What is the significance of `process.argv[2]` in the context of this script?

2. **File System Operations:**
   - Describe the role of the `fs` module in Node.js.
   - Explain the difference between `fs.writeFileSync` and `fs.unlinkSync`.
   - How does the script use `fs.writeFileSync` to add content to a file?
   - In the 'remove' branch, what does `fs.unlinkSync` do, and when might it be useful?

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Identify potential issues or errors that could occur in this script.
   - How would you enhance this script to handle errors, such as invalid file paths or missing content?
   - Discuss strategies for improving error handling and robustness in a script like this.

4. **Script Usage:**
   - Provide examples of valid command-line inputs for adding content to a file and removing a file.
   - What happens if a user enters an invalid command or forgets to provide necessary arguments?
   - How would you modify the script to make it more user-friendly?

5. **Security Considerations:**
   - Discuss security considerations related to accepting file paths and content from command-line arguments.
   - How might you validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential security risks?

6. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Suggest alternative approaches or improvements to achieve similar functionality.
   - What are the advantages and disadvantages of synchronous file operations in this script?

7. **Node.js Basics:**
   - Explain the event-driven, non-blocking nature of Node.js and how it relates to file operations in this script.

These questions cover a range of topics and can help assess the understanding of Node.js, file system operations, command-line interaction, error handling, and security considerations.
